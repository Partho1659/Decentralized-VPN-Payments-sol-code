# Decentralized VPN Payments

## 🧾 Project Description
This smart contract enables users to make decentralized payments to VPN providers using the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures transparent and trustless payment settlement between users and service providers.

## 🎯 Project Vision
The aim is to build a fully decentralized VPN ecosystem where users can securely and privately pay providers without relying on centralized intermediaries. This empowers freedom of information and privacy.

## ✨ Key Features
- 💸 **Simple Payments**: Users can directly pay VPN providers.
- 📤 **Provider Withdrawals**: VPN providers can withdraw their earned balance anytime.
- 🔒 **Ownership & Emergency Control**: The contract owner has an emergency fund recovery mechanism.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 🌐 Integration with IPFS or other decentralized storage for VPN provider metadata.
- 🪙 Support for stablecoins or other ERC-20 tokens for payment.
- 🔐 Enhanced authentication using zk-SNARKs or on-chain identity.
- 📊 Provider rating system and usage analytics.
- 🧱 Layer-2 support for scalability and reduced gas costs.
